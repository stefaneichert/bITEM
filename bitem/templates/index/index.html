                                On August 7, 1908, during an excavation led by Josef Szombathy, one of
                                the most famous archaeological discoveries was made: the Venus of
                                Willendorf. This remarkable ca. 29,500 years old figurine was
                                unearthed in Willendorf, Lower Austria, in the picturesque Wachau
                                Valley. This case study delves into the fascinating history and
                                research of the Venus of Willendorf, tracing her journey from the
                                moment she was found to her significance in the present day.

                                On 30 April 1857, the Austrian navy set sail on its first circumnavigation 
                                of the globe as part of the Novara Expedition. This pioneering voyage 
                                inspired the scientific community of the time and led to important 
                                discoveries, for example on Saint Paul's Island, the Nicobar Islands 
                                and in New Zealand. The collected botanical, zoological and ethnological 
                                exhibits enriched numerous museums and laid the foundation for the 
                                Natural History Museum Vienna. This case study highlights the 
                                remarkable achievements and lasting legacy of the Novara Expedition.

                                Surrounding the Mitterhof farm in Lower Austria lies a small but 
                                historically fascinating area with traces of settlement dating back 
                                to the Early Bronze Age and onwards. This area, located at the Czech 
                                border, experienced various phases of human history, including the 
                                Middle Bronze Age, the Latène period, the Marcomannic Wars and the 
                                early to late Middle Ages. Of particular interest are several 
                                Bronze Age and 5th century burials and the so-called ‘Runde Berg’, 
                                which may have been used both as a prehistoric burial mound and a 
                                medieval motte-and-bailey castle. This case study reveals the 
                                fascinating history and changes to the Mitterhof site.
