        <p>
            The bITEM project - short for Beyond the Item - Biographies and
            Itineraries of Cultural Heritage Objects in Museums and beyond - aims
            to present well-known museum objects in a state-of-the-art web
            application that is freely accessible online. The objects and their
            biographies are vividly described and, in addition to images and
            texts, 3D models as digital twins, timelines, and story maps are made
            available. Furthermore, the objects are presented with important
            actors in network visualizations.
            Object bibliographies thus become traceable and the journey of the
            exhibits to the museum is easy to understand.

            Within the project, data is digitized according to the

            Data are mapped using
