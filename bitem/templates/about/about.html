                    <p>The bITEM project - short for Beyond the Item - Biographies and
                        Itineraries of Cultural Heritage Objects in Museums and beyond - aims
                        to present well-known museum objects in a state-of-the-art web
                        application that is freely accessible online. The objects and their
                        biographies are vividly described and, in addition to images and
                        texts, 3D models as digital twins, timelines, and story maps are made
                        available. Furthermore, the objects are presented with important
                        actors in network visualizations.
                        Object bibliographies thus become traceable and the journey of the
                        exhibits to the museum is easy to understand.

                        Within the project, data is digitized according to the
